I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree at the KAIST, South Korea. 

During high school, I participated in several national and international mathematical olympiads. I am Bronze medal winner at [IMO, 2017](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=26093). After 16 years living in Azerbaijan, I moved to South Korea to pursue my studies in Computer Science and Mathematics.

Interests
