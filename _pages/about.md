<!-- {% include base_path %} -->

I am 1st year Master student in Computer Science at EPFL, Switzerland. 

During high school, I participated in several national and international mathematical olympiads. I am Bronze medal winner at [IMO, 2017](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=26093). 

After 16 years living in Azerbaijan, I moved to South Korea to further my studies. I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the KAIST, South Korea.

Interests
=========
I am interested in the fields of __3D Computer Vision and Computer Graphics__, because I believe we need better interpretation and understanding of both the real and visual world. Especially, I would like to work on and further explore __vision, robotics, autonomous driving, and graphics__ areas.
