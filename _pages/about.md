I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree at the KAIST, South Korea. Currently, I am working at Geometry and AI Lab, KAIST advised by [Prof. Minyuk Song](https://mhsung.github.io/). 

During high school, I participated in several national and international mathematical olympiads. I am Bronze medal winner at [IMO, 2017](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=26093). After 16 years living in Azerbaijan, I moved to South Korea to pursue my studies in Computer Science and Mathematics.

# Interests
I am interested in the fields of __3D Computer Vision and Computer Graphics__, because I believe we need better interpretation and understanding of both the real and visual world. Especially, I would like to work on and further explore __Neural implicit representations, 3D Motion, Geometry Processing__ areas and their applications in __vision, robotics, and graphics__. I am currently working on solving Motion Capture data where I am trying to understand the human body and motion from computer's perspective.
